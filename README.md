# Billify

A lightweight billing and accounting tool for freelancers.

## About

Billify a billing and accounting tool for freelancers.

It is based on AngularJS and runs locally in your browser (no web server
required).

This is a fun project for me to learn AngularJS. The code is based on
the [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate).

## Installation

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/mpm/billify
$ cd billify
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/billify/build/index.html` in your browser.

## Extending Billify

If you run into weird problems, try running

```sh
$ grunt compile
```
